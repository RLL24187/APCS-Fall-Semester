Hello there person!

Here's some stuff to remember!

-GitBash --> cd .ssh --> cd <APCS folder>
   -The above gets you to the master branch!
-git pull: takes the files from the GitHub website and brings them into your computer
-git clone: clones the files from the GitHub website and brings them into your computer
-git status: checks the files you are committing
-git add <file name>: adds a file to be committed
-cat <file name>: prints the text in the file on the terminal
-git rm <file name>: deletes the file completely
-git reset <file name>: removes a file from the commit
-git commit -m "<insert descriptive comment>": creates the commit to be pushed
-git push: pushes all the changes you've made to the files in the commit and saves them to the GitHub website :D
